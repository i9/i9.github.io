Some examples are depositing to and withdrawing from Celer, disputing in decentralized applications.

To track this on-chain transaction fee reserve, we created the concept of Reserved Fee. It helps you to track and make sure you always have some on-chain balances for such interactions."}},{"node":{"id":"92e33d6d-01b0-5d49-a43f-0a63865990d5","question":"What are the Apps?","category":"product","ans":"In CelerX, we are continuously launching and more and more fun applications built on top of Celer SDK.
